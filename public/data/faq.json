    "Q": "What is a hackathon?",
    "A": "A hackathon is 'coding marathon'. Participants form groups of one to four people and spend 24 hours developing whatever project excites them. Through workshops, mentors, mini-events, and teambuilding, participants will be able to create their project, grow their network, and learn exciting new concepts all in one night."
